title: Just So TrickyðŸª¤
---

The purpose of this series of articles is not to complain or criticize, but to share situations in C# programming that might be misused or are "counterintuitive", and to provide feasible solutions whenever possible. Of course, some of the mistakes might sound a bit laughable when spoken out loud, but they still need to be documented as a kind and helpful warning.
