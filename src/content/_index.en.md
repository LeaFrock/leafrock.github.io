üëã Welcome to my blog!

## Who Am I?

I'm LeaFrock, born in Jiangsu Province, China in 1992, and a graduate of the School of Information Science and Technology at Fudan University.

I am married with one child and currently based in Shanghai, where I work as a Senior .NET Backend Engineer at a Chinese enterprise.

My MBTI personality type has swung between `ENTP` and `ENTJ` over the years.

## What Am I Doing?

I first encountered C# during a university course and have been fond of this programming language ever since.
After graduation, my first job was as a liquid crystal panel manufacturing engineer, responsible for researching and managing the manufacturing process of liquid crystal drops. It was during this time that I often wrote C# programs to help my colleagues and me process data.

In 2015, I was offered an opportunity to work on the backend development of a game. Since then, I have been fully committed to professional C# development, accumulating rich experience and in-depth expertise.

Over the years, I have participated in numerous open-source and commercial projects, covering areas such as game backend development, web scraping, and web backend services.

My career plan is to become a cutting-edge **.NET Technology Expert**.

## What Do I Like?

### üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªTechnical Field

I am passionate about building high-performance backend systems that provide high-quality user experiences and am keen on solving code performance issues and making optimizations that are in line with or close to best practices. This includes projects that require real-time data processing, low-latency responses, and efficient resource utilization.

I have always contributed to the open-source community by writing technical articles, participating in open-source and commercial projects, and communicating with peers. I believe that sharing knowledge, participating in open-source projects, and collaborating on innovative solutions are the essence of community power and continuous learning.

### ü©µPersonal Interests

Since childhood, I have dreamed of becoming a physicist, a dream that may seem unrealistic now, but I still maintain an interest in mathematics and physics.

I am also a literature enthusiast, with a preference for traditional Chinese poetry, wuxia (martial arts fiction), science fiction, and popular novels. I have always wanted to write and publish a long wuxia novel, but progress has been slow.

I am also a steam game player. My favorite single-player games include The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI. My favorite online games are Dota 2 and World of Warcraft. Experiencing the ninth art or another life through games is the best way for me to relax and relieve stress.

## What Is This Blog For?

* To share my experience and insights in .NET development with more people, especially beginners. I was once a beginner myself and understand the pain and confusion of self-learning. I have also received a lot of help from seniors and the open-source community, and I hope my sharing can give back to more "former selves."
  
* If you are interested in a technical topic or are working on a related project, I hope we can find opportunities to collaborate through this blog. Whether it is to jointly develop a project or to discuss a complex technical problem, I am very much looking forward to working with like-minded friends.
  
* I also plan to use this blog as a record of my technical and other hobbies. Maybe I will publish my poems or wuxia novels here üòÜ?

* Perhaps I will also meet more interesting and valuable people because of this blogü§ù.
