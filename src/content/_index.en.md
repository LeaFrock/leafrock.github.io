## Who Am I?

I'm LeaFrock, a graduate of the School of Information Science and Technology at Fudan University. Currently based in Shanghai, I work as a Senior Backend Engineer specializing in .NET at a Chinese enterprise.

## What Am I Doing?

I was first introduced to C# during my university courses and have been fond of this programming language ever since. My first job after graduation was as a Liquid Crystal Display Panel Manufacturing Engineer, where I was responsible for researching and managing the manufacturing processes of liquid crystal drops. Even then, I frequently wrote C# programs to help myself and my colleagues process data.

In 2015, I was given an opportunity to work on a game backend development project. Since then, I have been deeply involved in professional C# development, building a strong foundation and expertise in this domain. Over the years, I have worked on a variety of challenging and rewarding projects, ranging from game backend development to web crawling and web backend services.

I am passionate about building high-performance backend systems that drive high-quality user experiences. I am enthusiastic about solving code performance issues and making optimizations, including working on projects that require real-time data processing, low-latency responses, and efficient resource utilization.

I have been contributing to the open-source community by writing articles, participating in projects, and engaging with fellow developers. I believe in the power of community and continuous learning through sharing knowledge, working on open-source projects, and collaborating on innovative solutions.
