## 原文

* 天上白玉皎盘，
  
  人间离思哀叹。
  
  满堂银霜空牵挂，
  
  对影孤意难遣。
  
* 泣花伤离蝶染，
  
  泪枝悲怨鸟散。
  
  一人独自枉嗟呀，
  
  相伴高枕入眠。
  
## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* The sky holds a bright, white jade plate,
  
  While mortals sigh with sorrow and lament.
  
  The hall is covered in silver frost, in vain,
  
  Facing the shadow, lonely thoughts hard to dismiss.
  
* Flowers weep for parting, butterflies stained with grief,
  
  Tearful branches, birds scatter with sorrowful belief.
  
  Alone, I sigh in vain, with no one near,
  
  I sleep alone, with dreams as my dear.

>This poem, titled "West River Moon: Mid-Autumn Festival," is a poignant expression of loneliness and longing during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The poet skillfully uses vivid imagery and consistent rhyme to evoke a deep sense of melancholy and isolation.
>
>In the first stanza, the poet contrasts the beauty of the full moon with the sorrow of human separation. The "bright, white jade plate" in the sky symbolizes the perfect and distant moon, while "mortals sigh with sorrow and lament" captures the emotional turmoil on earth. The "silver frost" covering the hall represents the cold and empty feeling of being apart from loved ones. The line "Facing the shadow, lonely thoughts hard to dismiss" further emphasizes the poet's solitude and the persistence of longing.
>
>The second stanza delves deeper into the poet's emotional state. "Flowers weep for parting, butterflies stained with grief" and "Tearful branches, birds scatter with sorrowful belief" use nature to mirror the poet's inner sorrow. The final lines, "Alone, I sigh in vain, with no one near. I sleep alone, with dreams as my dear," encapsulate the poet's loneliness and the temporary escape found in sleep and dreams.
>
>The consistent use of the "an" rhyme throughout the poem creates a harmonious and melancholic tone, enhancing the emotional depth. This poem is a beautiful reflection on the bittersweet nature of the Mid-Autumn Festival, where the beauty of the moon contrasts sharply with the pain of separation.
