## Source Text

* 愁云万里，
  
  斜雨穿叶梦昏时。
  
  暗尘幽起。
  
  枯坐灯未熄。
  
* 渐浓春意，
  
  胜似往年腻。
  
  只道是，
  
  心潮难止，
  
  寻常惹旧忆。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Gloomy clouds stretch for miles,
  
  Slanting rain pierces through leaves as dreams fade at dusk.
  
  Dark dust rises quietly.
  
  Sitting idle with the lamp still lit.
  
* The spring charm grows stronger,
  
  Outshining the past years' richness.
  
  I thought that,
  
  The surging emotions would never cease,
  
  Easily stirring up old memories.

>The second stanza shifts to a more reflective mood, with the intensifying spring charm contrasting sharply with the past. The phrase "surging emotions would never cease" highlights the poet's inner turmoil, and the final line about "stirring up old memories" ties the poem together, revealing a deep longing and the inescapable pull of nostalgia.
