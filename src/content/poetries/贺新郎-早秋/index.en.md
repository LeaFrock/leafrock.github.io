## Source Text

* 燕雀穿烟岭。
  
  乍风歇、残云又卷，暮蝉初静。
  
  道是无情潜合意，满目彩霞倒映。
  
  往故里、独蹊幽径。
  
  行倦拈花斜倚坐，续魂香、梦至巫山境。
  
  谒玉女，敲金磬。
  
* 石榴笑语娇声应。
  
  待雏菊露点千笔，共怀佳庆。
  
  秋色正逢此际好，霜晚时节肺病。
  
  再赋就、相思词令。
  
  槛外和来竹叶韵，隔墙落下桂子影。
  
  叹岁月，幻似镜。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Swallows dart through the misty ridges.

  As the wind ceases, scattered clouds roll again, and the evening cicadas fall still.

  It seems heartless yet subtly in tune, with colorful afterglow reflected in the view.

  I head to my hometown, down a secluded path.

  Tired from walking, I pluck a flower and lean against it to sit, its fragrance continues, and in my dream, I find myself in the realm of Mount Wu.
  
  I pay homage to the jade maidens, and the sound of gold chimes resounds.

* Pomegranates laugh and respond with a charming voice.

  Waiting for the chrysanthemums, with dewdrops like a thousand brushes, to celebrate together.

  The autumn scenery is at its finest now, but in the late frost season, lung ailments may arise.

  I compose once more, a verse of longing.

  Beyond the railing, the bamboo leaves create a rhythm, and the shadow of osmanthus flowers falls over the wall.

  I sigh, for time is like an illusion, a mirror.
