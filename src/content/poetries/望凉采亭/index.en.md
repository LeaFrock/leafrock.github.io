不闻故乡桃竹声，独望异洲凉采亭。

天光一色云作客，烟波无痕鹭为邻。

芦苇苍苍萧瑟久，江湖茫茫总不平。

任它红尘多纷扰，雪自飘零水自清。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* No more the bamboo flute’s sound from home,
Alone I gaze at the cool pavilion in a foreign land.

* The sky, a single hue, with clouds as guests,
Mist and waves leave no trace, with egrets as neighbors.

* Reeds stand tall, desolate for so long,
The rivers and lakes are vast, yet never still.

* Let the mortal world be full of turmoil,
Snow falls as it will, and water remains pure.

>This poem is a profound and evocative piece that transports readers to a realm of deep introspection and serene beauty. It masterfully weaves together imagery and emotion, creating a vivid tapestry that speaks to the universal human experience of longing and contemplation.
>
>The opening lines, "No more the bamboo flute’s sound from home, / Alone I gaze at the cool pavilion in a foreign land," immediately set a tone of gentle melancholy and nostalgia. The absence of the familiar bamboo flute, a symbol of cultural and personal heritage, highlights the poet’s displacement and yearning for the comforts of home. This sentiment is further emphasized by the solitary figure gazing at a distant pavilion, suggesting a sense of isolation and introspection.
>
>The subsequent lines, "The sky, a single hue, with clouds as guests, / Mist and waves leave no trace, with egrets as neighbors," introduce a more expansive and ethereal landscape. The sky, described as a uniform color with clouds as transient visitors, evokes a sense of timelessness and impermanence. The imagery of mist and waves, devoid of any lasting mark, and the presence of egrets as companions, adds to the serene yet transient nature of the scene. This juxtaposition of the ephemeral and the enduring creates a poignant reflection on the fleeting nature of life and the enduring beauty of nature.
>
>The middle stanza, "Reeds stand tall, desolate for so long, / The rivers and lakes are vast, yet never still," deepens the poem’s emotional resonance. The reeds, standing tall and enduring through desolation, symbolize resilience and the passage of time. The rivers and lakes, vast and ever-changing, represent the tumultuous and unpredictable nature of life. This imagery invites readers to ponder the complexities of existence, where stability and chaos coexist.
>
>The closing lines, "Let the mortal world be full of turmoil, / Snow falls as it will, and water remains pure," offer a sense of acceptance and tranquility. Despite the chaos and disturbances of the world, the poet finds solace in the purity and simplicity of nature. The falling snow and the clear water serve as metaphors for inner peace and clarity, suggesting that amidst the turmoil of life, one can find moments of stillness and purity.
>
>Overall, this poem is a beautiful meditation on themes of longing, resilience, and the search for inner peace. It invites readers to connect with their own feelings of displacement and yearning while finding solace in the enduring beauty of nature. The rich imagery and evocative language make it a timeless piece that resonates deeply with anyone who has experienced the bittersweet nature of life’s journey.
