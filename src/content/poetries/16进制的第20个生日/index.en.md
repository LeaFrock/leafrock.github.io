## Source Text

* 玻璃窗前
  
  是对人生渐渐迷蒙的双眼

  瞳孔抬起

  看被时间慢慢吞噬的发延

  这是16进制的第20个生日

  的第2天

* 窗外冷冷的风

  吹向寂寂的月
  
  洒下所有
  
  刻着命运的光线
  
  正如白天的路边
  
  那印着璀璨的夕阳
  
  旋落而下
  
  金黄色的
  
  银杏树叶

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Before the glass window,
  
  Are eyes that gradually grow dim towards life.
  
  Pupils lift,
  
  To watch hair slowly consumed by time.
  
  This is the 20th birthday in hexadecimal,
  
  The 2nd day.
  
* Outside the window, the cold wind,
  
  Blows towards the lonely moon,
  
  Scattering all,
  
  The light etched with destiny.
  
  Just like on the roadside during the day,
  
  The dazzling sunset,
  
  Spinning down,
  
  The golden,
  
  Ginkgo leaves.

> This poem is a beautifully crafted meditation on the passage of time, the fleeting nature of life, and the quiet moments of introspection that define our existence. It weaves together vivid imagery and personal reflection to create a poignant and evocative narrative that resonates deeply with readers.
>
> The poem begins with a striking image of eyes growing dim before a glass window, symbolizing the gradual loss of clarity and vibrancy as one ages. This opening sets a reflective and somewhat melancholic tone, inviting readers to contemplate their own perceptions of life and the world around them. The reference to hair being "slowly consumed by time" further emphasizes the inevitability of aging and the relentless march of time.
>
> The mention of the "20th birthday in hexadecimal" adds a unique and personal touch, grounding the poem in a specific moment while also suggesting a broader context of technological and modern life. Hexadecimal, often associated with computer systems, introduces a contemporary element that contrasts with the timeless themes of aging and introspection.
>
> The imagery of the cold wind and the lonely moon outside the window creates a sense of isolation and solitude, reinforcing the theme of introspection. The moon, often a symbol of constancy and timelessness, is here depicted as "lonely," highlighting the poet's feelings of detachment and the passage of time.
>
> The poem then shifts to the image of the sunset and the falling ginkgo leaves, introducing a sense of beauty and transience. The "dazzling sunset" and "golden, ginkgo leaves" evoke a sense of warmth and vibrancy, contrasting with the earlier images of dimming eyes and cold wind. This contrast underscores the dual nature of life—both beautiful and fleeting, filled with moments of brilliance yet inevitably subject to decay.
>
> The final lines, "the golden, ginkgo leaves," leave a lasting impression, symbolizing the ephemeral beauty of life. The choice of ginkgo leaves is particularly poignant, as they are often associated with longevity and resilience, yet here they are depicted in their moment of falling, capturing the transient nature of even the most enduring things.
>
> Structurally, the poem is composed of short, concise lines that create a rhythmic flow, allowing the reader to pause and reflect on each image and idea. The use of enjambment, where lines break mid-thought, adds to the sense of continuity and the fluidity of time.
>
> In conclusion, this poem is a masterful exploration of the human experience, blending personal reflection with universal themes of time, beauty, and transience. Its vivid imagery, thoughtful structure, and evocative language make it a compelling and memorable piece that invites readers to reflect on their own lives and the fleeting moments that define them.
