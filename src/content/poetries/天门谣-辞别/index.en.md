## Source Text

* 风啸辞别意，卷沙土、尽遮尘路。
  
  西望去，更多情踌躇！
  
* 四月乱花娇歌慢舞， 玉管石琴新奏谱。
  
  孰伴鼓？
  
  泪水苦，离伤更苦！

* The wind howls with a farewell tone, rolling up the sand and soil, covering the   dusty path.
  
  Looking to the west, there is even more hesitation and lingering affection!
  
* In April, the chaotic flowers dance gracefully and sing softly, with new tunes   played on jade flutes and stone chimes.

  The tears are bitter, and the pain of parting is even more bitter!

These elements create a sense of desolation and uncertainty, setting the stage for the emotional journey of farewell.

The use of the word "more" intensifies the depth of these emotions, suggesting that the act of parting is not just a physical separation but a profound emotional struggle.
>
>In the second stanza, the poet employs a stark contrast by introducing the beauty of April's blooming flowers and the gentle music of jade flutes and stone chimes. This contrast serves to highlight the poignancy of the farewell, as the beauty of the surroundings only deepens the sense of loss and sorrow.
>
>The final lines of the poem pose a rhetorical question about who will accompany the drum, a traditional instrument used in farewells. The answer is implied in the following lines: the tears are bitter, and the pain of parting is even more so. This repetition of the word "bitter" underscores the intensity of the emotional pain, leaving the reader with a profound sense of the sorrow that accompanies parting.
