## Source Text

* 玉竹清荷私语里，一帘幽梦空空。
  
  门前折柳问相逢，午时倦倦，雨瘦恨意浓。

* 人生自古无常乐，归途凋尽残红。
  
  高山流水赠英雄，且将泪却，留待寄秋风。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Whispers among jade bamboo and lotus, a curtain of empty dreams.
  
  At the gate, I break a willow, asking when we'll meet again.
  At noon, I'm weary, the rain is thin, my sorrow deepens.
  
* Since ancient times, life has no constant joy, the journey back, all reds wither away.
  
  To the hero, I give the music of mountains and streams,
  I hold back my tears for now, to send them with the autumn breeze.
