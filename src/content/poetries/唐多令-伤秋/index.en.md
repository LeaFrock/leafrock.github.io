## Source Text

* 桂树倚墙老。
  
  黄花冷院凋。
  
  往岁梅、空自妖娆。
  
  凉夜秋风吹旧梦，
  
  纵蟋蟀、亦声悄。
  
* 何处诉心潮？
  
  难将余恨抛。
  
  断鸿去、落木萧萧。
  
  当世浮沉倾作笑，
  
  灯前袖、泪痕消。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* The osmanthus tree leans against the wall, aged.
  
  Chrysanthemums wither in the cold courtyard.
  
  The plum blossoms of bygone years, in vain, once bloomed so fair.
  
  On the cool autumn night, the wind blows away old dreams,
  
  Even the crickets fall silent in their tunes.

* Where can I pour out my surging heart?
  
  Hard to cast away the lingering regrets.
  
  The broken wild geese depart, leaves fall in desolate rows.
  
  In this world, I laugh at the rise and fall,
  
  Before the lamp, I wipe away my tears, but the traces remain.

>
>The poem begins with the depiction of an aged osmanthus tree leaning against a wall and withering chrysanthemums in a cold courtyard. These images set a somber tone, evoking a sense of decay and the passage of time. The mention of plum blossoms from bygone years, which once bloomed so beautifully but now exist only in memory, further emphasizes the fleeting nature of beauty and the inevitability of change.
>
>The poet then shifts to the cool autumn night, where the wind disperses old dreams and even the crickets fall silent. This imagery not only highlights the quiet desolation of the season but also symbolizes the poet's own feelings of loneliness and the fading of past joys. The silence of the crickets suggests a world where even nature's usual sounds are muted by the weight of melancholy.
>
>In the second half of the poem, the poet expresses a deep sense of helplessness and sorrow. The question "Where can I pour out my surging heart?" reflects the poet's struggle to find an outlet for their emotions. The lingering regrets and the sight of wild geese flying away, leaving behind falling leaves, further underscore the feelings of loss and the transient nature of life.
>
>Ultimately, the poet tries to laugh at the ups and downs of life, attempting to find a sense of detachment. However, the final image of wiping away tears before the lamp, with traces remaining, reveals that the pain and sorrow cannot be completely erased. This poem beautifully captures the bittersweet essence of autumn, blending natural imagery with profound emotional depth. It is a timeless expression of the human experience of confronting the passage of time and the enduring impact of lost memories.
