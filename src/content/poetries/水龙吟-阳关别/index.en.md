## 原文

* 潇潇暮雨昏昼，红衰翠减人亦瘦。
  
  临河相诀，垂泪沾袖，最堪消受！
  
  莫登危楼，断鸿孤去，难望中秋。
  
  惟只手折柳，细叶枯拂。
  
  怎不晓，哀离愁？
  
* 再休唱阳关彻，西风冷残阳顿坠。
  
  青丝华发，伤心流年，千古轮回。
  
  故人把酒，黯然销魂，唯别而已。
  
  知何处肠断？海棠娇落，柳丝轻柔。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Drizzling evening rain blurs the day, red petals fade, green leaves thin, and so do I.
  
  By the river, we part with final words, tears fall, sleeves soaked, hard to endure!
  
  Don't climb the perilous tower, the lone wild goose flies away, hard to gaze upon   the Mid-Autumn day.
  
  With only one hand, I break the willow, fine leaves wither, brush against my sleeve.
  
  How could I not know, the sorrow of parting?
  
* Sing no more the "Yang Pass" tune, the west wind chills, the sun suddenly sets.
  
  Black hair turns white, grieving over the years, through ages it repeats.
  
  Old friends raise their cups, in deep sorrow, the soul departs.
  
  Where does the heart break? The delicate begonia falls, the willow threads are   gentle.
