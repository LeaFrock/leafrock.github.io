* 西风飕，别时吹得眉消瘦。
  
  看寒雪梅花，顿是泪痕剔透。
  
  河上暮日染轻绪，林间枯枝吐浓愁。
  
  再聚首，千纷万扰，难断时候。
  
* 怀旧。

  熬流年，凄清冷苦，不堪忍受。
  
  拟图一醉，沉梦把盏花满楼。
  
  肯将韶光付山水，觅得常伴逍遥游。
  
  备彩笺，寄相思，盼君也相投。

* The west wind howls, thinning my brows as we part.
  
  Gazing at the cold snow and plum blossoms, tears glisten and pierce through.
  
  At dusk, the river’s sun tints light sorrows, while bare branches in the grove exude deep melancholy.
  
  When we meet again, amidst chaos and turmoil, it’s hard to find the right moment.
  
* Nostalgia.
  
  Enduring the years, in bleakness and cold, unbearable.
  
  Hoping to get drunk, to sink into dreams with a cup in hand, surrounded by blossoms.
  
  Willing to spend my youth in mountains and rivers, to find a companion for carefree   wanderings.
  
  Preparing colorful paper, to send my longing, hoping you’ll reciprocate.
