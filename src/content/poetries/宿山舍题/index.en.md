## Source Text

雨摧芳草露沾香，风卷残云日落斜。

游山彷徨空前梦，凭栏遥望独此家。

寂寞栽桂成知己，潇洒煮酒对鱼虾。

叹惋孰人留仙迹，面壁徒思无应答。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

Rain beats the fragrant grass, dew clings and spreads its scent,
Wind rolls up the remnants of clouds as the sun sets askew.

Lost in the mountains, I find an old dream,
Leaning on the railing, I see only this lonely lodge.

In solitude, the osmanthus planted by someone long gone,
In carefree ease, wine brewed and fish and shrimp from the stream.

I wonder who left these traces of a hermit's life,
Gazing at the wall, I ponder, but no answer comes.
