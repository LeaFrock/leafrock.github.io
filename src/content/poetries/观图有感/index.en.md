苏州河畔烟绕柳，黄埔江上风戏鸥。

旧忆徒让眉间皱，春色不解人心愁。

昔道年年花依旧，今朝却难故地游。

独剩桃花系残雨，一轮明月挂枝头。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* By the Suzhou River, mist entwines the willows,  
  On the Huangpu River, the wind plays with gulls.  

* Old memories only furrow the brow,  
  Spring’s beauty fails to soothe the heart’s sorrow.  

* Once said that every year the flowers remain the same,  
  Today, it’s hard to visit the old places again.  

* Only peach blossoms are left, tied to the lingering rain,  
  A bright full moon hangs from the branches.
