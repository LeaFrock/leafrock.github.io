## Source Text

——*下班路上骑着爱玛电动车望见弯弯的月亮有感*

昔日呼玉盘，今夜似银钩。

浮云最得意，春风亦叽啁。

盈亏皆天运，逍遥倚危楼。

他时重抖擞，天下共白头。

## AI Translation

——*On Seeing the Crescent Moon While Riding My Electric Scooter Home from Work*

Once called a jade plate, tonight a silver hook.

The clouds, so proud, block the moon’s light; the spring breeze jeers.

Waxing and waning are all by fate’s design, so the moon doesn't care and rests on a high tower.

One day, the moon will shine bright again, and all will share its silver glow.
