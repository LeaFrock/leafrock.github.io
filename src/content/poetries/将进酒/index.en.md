## Source Text

君不见，蓬莱仙境海难寻，渺茫沧桑不堪尽。

君不见，风花雪月安可羡？昨如青童今鹤颜！

欲踏青风访仙踪，恐惊明月寒夜宫。

有缘千里来相会，人生何处不相逢！

醉酒更觉须放歌，莫使凄凉叹花落。

兰君子，松高人，将进酒，共此生。

与尔歌一曲，暂将闲情遣愁闷。

万钟千金不足贵，但使我愿不可违。

南柯一梦宜复醒，空令白首为功名。

流光轻易江涛逝，抱月长终为谁生？

不如潇洒与月醉，何妨凡俗妒我心！

­­­此别易，再见难，悲欢离合最无情，清风追月闻笛声。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Do you not see, the fairyland of Penglai is hard to find,
  
  Lost in the vast and desolate sea, beyond reach of mind.
  
* Do you not see, the joys of love and moon are not to envy?
  
  Yesterday a youth, today an old man with a crane-like visage, how can this be steady?
  
* I wish to tread the green breeze to seek the immortal’s trace,
  
  Yet fear to startle the cold night palace of the bright moon’s face.
  
* If fate brings us together from a thousand miles away,
  
  Where in life shall we not meet, come what may?
  
* In drunkenness, I feel the urge to sing,
  
  Do not let sorrowful sighs greet the falling spring.
  
* Lan, the noble lord, and pine, the lofty man,
  
  Let us drink wine, and share this life’s span.
  
* I’ll sing a song for you, to banish idle cares and gloom,
  
* Ten thousand measures of gold are not as precious as a heart that’s true.
  
* The dream of Nanke should awaken once again,
  
  Lest white hair be spent in vain, chasing fame and gain.
  
* Time easily flows away like river waves,
  
  Who is it that holds the moon, to the end of their days?
  
* Better to be carefree, drunk with the moon’s light,
  
  Why care if the common world envies my delight?
  
* This parting is easy, but meeting again is hard,
  
  Joy and sorrow, partings and meetings, are the cruelest by far,
  
  With the clear breeze chasing the moon, the flute’s sound is heard from afar.
