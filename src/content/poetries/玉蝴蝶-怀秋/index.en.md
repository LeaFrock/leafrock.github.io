## Source Text

* 最易光阴虚度，早秋不待，晚景萧条。
  
  频起狂风，败尽红翠方消。
  
  院墙里、枯藤伤倚，
  
  林遥处、逐隐哀嚎。

  怎逍遥？

  群芳皆靡，唯水滔滔。

* 昔朝。

  汊河斜巷，望穿轻雾，菡萏正娇。
  
  哪晓今时，残荷坠坠冷石桥。
  
  故乡亭、魂萦梦绕，
  
  前程路、烟雨飘摇。
  
  奈情薄。
  
  垂髫不再，难唱童谣。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* How easily time is wasted, with early autumn arriving and late scenes desolate.
  
  Frequent gales arise, withering all the red and green, leaving nothing but   desolation.
  
  Within the courtyard walls, withered vines lean in sorrow,
  
  And in the distant woods, the partridge's mournful cry can be heard.
  
  How can one find joy?
  
  All flowers have withered, while only the waters flow ceaselessly.
  
* In days of yore.
  
  By the forked river and the narrow alley, through the light mist, the lotus flowers were in full bloom.
  
  Who could have known that now, withered lotuses hang low over the cold stone bridge.
  
  The old pavilion in my hometown, where my soul lingers and dreams return,
  
  And the path ahead, tossed by misty rain.
  
  Alas, how thin the bonds of affection have become.
  
  Childhood days are gone, and I can no longer sing the nursery rhymes.

>
>The poem opens with a lament on the fleeting nature of time, as early autumn arrives without warning, leaving behind a desolate late autumn scene. The imagery of frequent gales that wither all the red and green leaves creates a vivid picture of nature's decline, symbolizing the transient beauty of life. The poet then shifts focus to the courtyard, where withered vines lean sorrowfully against the walls, and in the distant woods, the mournful cry of the partridge can be heard. These images evoke a sense of loneliness and desolation, setting a melancholic tone for the poem.
>
>In the second part, the poet reminisces about the past, contrasting the current desolate scene with the vibrant beauty of lotus flowers in full bloom by the forked river. The phrase "Who could have known that now" highlights the unexpected and irreversible passage of time, as the once-lush lotuses now hang low over a cold stone bridge. The poet's nostalgia is further emphasized by the mention of the old pavilion in his hometown, where his soul lingers and dreams return. The path ahead, however, is fraught with uncertainty and hardship, symbolized by the "misty rain."
>
>The final lines express a deep sense of resignation and loss. The poet laments the thinning of emotional bonds and the passing of childhood days, a time when simple joys like singing nursery rhymes were possible. This sense of irretrievable loss and the passage of time is a central theme of the poem, resonating with readers who have experienced the bittersweet nature of nostalgia.
