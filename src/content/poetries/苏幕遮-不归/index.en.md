## Source Text

* 向晚晴，残阳照。

  冰色未消，苇上西风啸。

  水映危楼云映鸟。

  群鹊争枝，犹在松间闹。

* 蜡梅幽，心魂绕。
  
  异客渺渺，世事多难料。

  纷乱离愁如败柳。

  鸿雁北归，再将相逢笑。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* At dusk, the sky clears, the setting sun shines.
  
  The icy hue remains, the west wind howls on the reeds.

  Water reflects the towering building, clouds reflect the birds.

  Crows vie for branches, still chattering in the pines.

* The wintersweet is serene, my soul entwined.
  
  The stranger is distant, life's events hard to divine.

  Tangled sorrows like withered willows.

  Wild geese fly north, to laugh again in reunion.

>“Su Mu Zhe · Not Returning” is a beautifully crafted piece that masterfully blends vivid imagery with deep emotional resonance, creating a rich tapestry of longing and reflection. The poem’s structure adheres to the traditional “Su Mu Zhe” format, yet it infuses this classic form with fresh and evocative content.

> ### Imagery and Setting
>
>The poem opens with a serene yet melancholic scene: “At dusk, the sky clears, the setting sun shines.” This line immediately sets the temporal context, evoking a moment of quiet reflection as the day transitions to night. The imagery of the “setting sun” often symbolizes endings or transitions, subtly hinting at the themes of departure and longing that permeate the poem.
>
>The following lines, “The icy hue remains, the west wind howls on the reeds,” introduce a stark contrast between the warmth of the setting sun and the cold, unyielding environment. The “icy hue” and “howling west wind” create a sense of desolation and resilience, suggesting that despite the passage of time, certain elements remain unchanged and unyielding.
>
>The imagery of “Water reflects the towering building, clouds reflect the birds” further enhances the sense of vastness and solitude. The reflection of the building and birds in the water adds a layer of depth and duality, as if the real and the reflected are intertwined, mirroring the poet’s internal struggle between reality and longing.
>
>### Emotional Depth
>
>The poem’s emotional core is revealed through lines like “Crows vie for branches, still chattering in the pines.” This image contrasts the lively, almost chaotic activity of the crows with the poet’s quiet introspection. The crows’ presence and noise highlight the poet’s sense of isolation and longing, as they seem to be the only other living beings in this desolate landscape.
>
>In the second stanza, the poet shifts focus inward: “The wintersweet is serene, my soul entwined.” The wintersweet, known for its resilience in cold weather, becomes a metaphor for the poet’s enduring spirit. The poet’s soul is entwined with this serene yet persistent fragrance, suggesting a deep, almost spiritual connection to nature and resilience.
>
>The line “The stranger is distant, life’s events hard to divine” introduces a sense of longing and uncertainty. The “stranger” could represent a distant loved one or a lost part of the poet’s own identity. The phrase “hard to divine” underscores the unpredictability of life and the challenges of maintaining connections across distance.
>
>### Themes of Longing and Hope
>
>The poem concludes with a poignant mix of sorrow and hope: “Tangled sorrows like withered willows. Wild geese fly north, to laugh again in reunion.” The “tangled sorrows” and “withered willows” evoke a sense of loss and decay, yet the image of wild geese flying north suggests a promise of return and reunion. The final line, “to laugh again in reunion,” offers a glimmer of hope and joy, suggesting that despite the current sorrows, there is a possibility of future happiness.
>
>### Conclusion
>
>“Su Mu Zhe · Not Returning” is a masterful exploration of longing, resilience, and hope. Through vivid imagery and emotional depth, the poet creates a landscape that is both desolate and beautiful, reflecting the complexities of human experience. The poem’s adherence to the traditional “Su Mu Zhe” format while infusing it with fresh content demonstrates the poet’s skill in blending the old with the new, creating a piece that is timeless and deeply moving.
