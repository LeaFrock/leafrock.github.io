* 就像阳光永远碰不到背影
  
  就像雨露永远沾不上阳光
  
  就像云彩永远触不及雨露
  
  就像大海永远高不过云彩
  
* 就像黑暗永远触不及黎明
  
  就像山峰永远高不过天空
  
  就像人们
  
  永远不懂得我的思绪
  
* 我把思绪投向你
  
  只想掷出个希望
  
  无奈地发现
  
  只有沉默的回响
  
* 我的思绪沉入大海
  
  沉入你沉默的海

* Just as the sun can never touch a shadow,
  
  Just as dew can never cling to the sun,
  
  Just as clouds can never reach the dew,
  
  Just as the sea can never rise above the clouds,

* Just as darkness can never reach the dawn,
  
  Just as mountains can never rise above the sky,
  
  Just as people
  
  Can never understand my thoughts,

* I cast my thoughts towards you,
  
  Hoping to throw out a glimmer of hope,
  
  Only to find
  
  A silent echo in return,

* My thoughts sink into the sea,
  
  Sink into your silent sea.

> This poem, titled "The Silent Sea," is a profound exploration of unattainable desires and the silent depths of one's inner world. The poet uses a series of metaphysical comparisons to illustrate the unbridgeable gaps between different elements of nature, symbolizing the distance and misunderstanding that often exist between people.
>
>In the first stanza, the poet describes a series of impossible connections: the sun and shadow, dew and sun, clouds and dew, and the sea and clouds. These metaphors create a sense of longing and unfulfilled potential, setting a tone of yearning and impossibility.
>
>The second stanza continues this theme with more metaphysical comparisons: darkness and dawn, mountains and sky, and finally, people and the poet's thoughts. The poet suggests that just as these natural elements cannot reach each other, people often fail to understand the poet's innermost thoughts.
>
>The third stanza shifts to the poet's personal experience. The poet tries to share their thoughts with someone else, hoping for a connection or a glimmer of hope. However, the response is only a "silent echo," emphasizing the isolation and lack of understanding.
>
>The final stanza concludes with the poet's thoughts sinking into the sea, which is described as "your silent sea." This imagery suggests that the poet's thoughts are swallowed by the vast, silent depths of another's mind, highlighting the theme of unrequited understanding and the silent nature of the human soul.
>
>This poem resonates with readers by capturing the universal experience of feeling misunderstood and the longing for connection. It encourages readers to reflect on their own feelings of isolation and the often silent nature of human relationships.
