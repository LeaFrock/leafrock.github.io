## Source Text

* 撑渡惊飞洲上鹭。
  
  明月如钩，垂钓披蓑渚。

  玉兔岂知凡世苦，夜寒宫冷听空杵。

* 偕老平生能几许？
  
  流岁苍枯，莫问回头路！
  
  孤枕霜石求好梦，相思寄往佳人处。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Plying the oar, I startle the egrets on the isle,
  
  The crescent moon, like a hook, hangs low,
  Anglers in straw capes fish by the shore.
  
  The jade hare knows not the world's sorrow,
  In the cold palace, it hears the empty pestle's sound.
  
* How many can share a lifetime together?
  
  Years flow by, turning green to withered brown,
  No turning back, no looking around!
  
  Alone on the frosty stone, I seek a good dream,
  Sending my longing to my beloved, far away.

>This poem, titled "Que Ta Zhi: Missing a Beloved," is a beautiful and evocative work that captures the essence of longing and the passage of time through vivid imagery and deep emotion. The poem is structured in two parts, each rich in traditional Chinese poetic elements.
>
>In the first part, the poet uses a series of vivid images to set the scene: the startled egrets, the crescent moon, and the anglers in straw capes. These images evoke a serene yet slightly melancholic atmosphere by the riverside. The mention of the jade hare (a symbol of the moon) and the cold palace introduces a celestial element, contrasting the indifference of the heavens with the poet's own feelings of sorrow and isolation.
>
>The second part shifts to a more introspective and emotional tone. The poet reflects on the rarity of lifelong companionship and the relentless passage of time, which turns youthful vitality into decay. The phrase "No turning back, no looking around" conveys a sense of resignation and acceptance, acknowledging that time moves forward and cannot be reversed. The final lines reveal the poet's deep longing: seeking solace in dreams and sending his love to a distant beloved.
>
>The poem's beauty lies in its ability to blend natural imagery with profound emotions, creating a vivid and poignant atmosphere. The use of traditional poetic devices, such as allusion and parallelism, enhances its depth and resonance. It is a timeless expression of love and loss, reminding us of the ephemeral nature of life and the enduring power of longing.
