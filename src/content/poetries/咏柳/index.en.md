## Source Text

碧波镜前妆正抹，喜鹊枝头笑意浓。

群草齐长添新色，数蛙时鸣和远钟。

斜塘畔侧唤飞燕，揽月桥下戏渔翁。

最谢浮生承平久，闲情春色总相逢。

## AI Translation

* Before the mirror of emerald waves, makeup is freshly spread,

  On the branch, the magpie’s joy is deep and bright.

* Grasses grow in unison, adding fresh shades,

  Frogs croak from time to time, in harmony with the distant bell.

* By the slanting pond, swallows are summoned,

  Under the moonlit bridge, fishermen play.

* Most thankful for the enduring peace of this fleeting life,

  Leisurely sentiments and spring colors always meet.

This blend of nature and human activity highlights the harmony between man and nature, suggesting a peaceful coexistence.
