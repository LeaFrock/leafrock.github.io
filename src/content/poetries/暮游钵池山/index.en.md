## Source Text

遥闻真君驭龙啸，远望仙人炼丹烟。

飞鸿千里传音去，暮日一线抹霞开。

曲径夕石泣幽竹，古桥流水咽冷松。

钵中碧霄意常在，池上柔波心自空。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* From afar, I hear the Dragon Lord's roar,
  
  In the distance, I see the immortal's alchemy smoke.
  
* A wild goose flies a thousand miles to send a message,
  
  The setting sun draws a line, painting the sky with rosy hues.
  
* On the winding path, evening stones weep with the bamboo's sigh,
  
  Over the ancient bridge, the cold pine chokes on the flowing water's cry.
  
* In the bowl(Bo), the azure sky's spirit ever remains,
  
  On the pond(Chi), the gentle ripples empty the heart of its chains.
