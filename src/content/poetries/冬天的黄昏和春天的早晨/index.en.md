## Source Text

* 树叶还是绿的，

  空气还是凉的，

  路人一样的稀少，

  天色一样的朦胧。

* 如果忘了罗盘的方向，
  
  如果忘了钟表的时间，
  
  谁也分不清，
  
  这是冬天的黄昏，
  
  还是春天的早晨。

* 仿佛是谁在留恋春天的生机，
  
  仿佛是谁在抗拒冬天的颓靡，
  
  往往在最苦涩的现实里，
  
  才会发觉被忽略的甜蜜。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* The leaves are still green,
  
  The air is still cool,
  
  The streets are just as sparse,
  
  The sky is just as hazy.

* If you forget the direction of the compass,
  
  If you forget the time on the clock,
  
  No one can tell,
  
  Whether it's winter dusk,
  
  Or spring dawn.

* As if someone is lingering over the vitality of spring,
  
  As if someone is resisting the desolation of winter,
  
  Often in the most bitter reality,
  
  One discovers the sweetness that was overlooked.

>In the first stanza, the poet describes a scene where the leaves are still green, the air is cool, the streets are sparse, and the sky is hazy. These details evoke a sense of transition, where the characteristics of both winter and spring coexist, making it difficult to distinguish one from the other.
>
>The second stanza delves into the idea of forgetting conventional markers of time and direction. By forgetting the compass and the clock, the poet suggests that the boundaries between winter dusk and spring dawn become even more indistinct. This ambiguity invites readers to question their perceptions of time and season.
