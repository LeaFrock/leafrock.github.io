遥闻君子成名久，今过门前思睹颜。

孰晓群峦齐障目，风采尽入雾中埋。

三顾茅庐天下计，好事多磨犹可期。

他日借得盘古斧，斩得云开还复来！

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Long have I heard of the noble one’s fame,  
  Now passing by, I wish to behold his face.  

* Who knew the mountains would block my view,  
  All his charm buried deep in the mist.  

* Thrice I’ve sought wisdom at the thatched door,  
  Good things come with trials, but hope remains.  

* One day I’ll borrow Pangu’s mighty axe,  
  To cut through the clouds and come again.
