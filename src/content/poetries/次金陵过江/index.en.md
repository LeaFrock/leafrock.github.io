## Source Text

天际冥冥黑云集，孤舟故塔对愁倚。

长江滚滚东逝水，载尽六朝浮沉定。

吾今大观千古镜，慷慨兴亡叹非己。

沧海一声渔樵去，梦来多少轮回启。

但惜愿违难出世，原本俗尘人间栖。

欲归圣道惭无路，奈何潇洒反戚戚！

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

Dark clouds gather at the horizon, a solitary boat leans against an ancient pagoda in sorrow.

The Yangtze River rolls eastward, carrying away the rise and fall of six dynasties.

I now behold the mirror of a thousand years, lamenting the rise and fall that is not my own.

A fisherman and woodcutter vanish into the vast sea, how many cycles of dreams have begun.

Alas, my wishes are thwarted, making it hard to leave the world, for I am but a dweller in the mortal dust.

Wishing to return to the sacred path, I am ashamed to find no way, why then does my attempt at nonchalance end in sorrow!
