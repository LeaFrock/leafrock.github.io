柳色沉沉隐朱楼，

雨丝暗淡落白鸥。

北风笑儿不能语，

戏拾轻烟描清眸。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

The willow’s hue lies deep, hiding the red tower,

Dim raindrops fall on the white gull’s feathered power.

The north wind laughs, my child too young to speak,

Playing with the mist, tracing his clear eyes unique.

This imagery not only brings the scene to life but also conveys the deep affection and tenderness the poet feels for their child.
