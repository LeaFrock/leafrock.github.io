## Source Text

* 犹忆辞别烟雨中，影疏渐失行踪。
  
  浮世沧桑难相逢。
  
  漫步独彷徨，今生与谁同？
  
* 流光无语凝噎去，桃花依旧艳浓。
  
  相思又把泪染红。
  
  伊人踏何处？ 愁对月朦胧。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Still remember bidding farewell in the misty rain, Her figure sparse, gradually out of sight.
  
  In this world of vicissitudes, it’s hard to meet again.
  
  Wandering alone, lost in thought, Who will be with me in this life?
  
* Time passes silently, choked with sorrow, Peach blossoms still bloom, as bright as before.
  
  Longing turns my tears red once more.
  
  Where has my beloved stepped? Facing the hazy moon, I’m filled with woe.

>This poem, titled "Linjiangxian: Missing My Beloved," is a poignant expression of longing and loss. The poet vividly captures the essence of separation and the enduring pain of unfulfilled love through rich imagery and emotional depth.
>
>In the first stanza, the poet reminisces about parting in the "misty rain," a scene that evokes a sense of melancholy and nostalgia. The image of the beloved’s "sparse figure" disappearing into the distance symbolizes the finality of the separation, leaving the poet alone and adrift. The line "Who will be with me in this life?" poignantly reflects the poet’s deep sense of loneliness and yearning for companionship.
>
>The second stanza delves deeper into the passage of time and the persistence of longing. "Time passes silently, choked with sorrow" highlights the relentless nature of time, which cannot be halted or reversed. The contrast between the enduring beauty of the "peach blossoms" and the poet’s increasing sorrow underscores the cruel irony of nature’s indifference to human emotions. The final lines, "Where has my beloved stepped? Facing the hazy moon, I’m filled with woe," encapsulate the poet’s uncertainty and despair, as the beloved’s whereabouts remain unknown, and the poet is left to confront their grief alone under the dim moonlight.
>
>Overall, this poem masterfully weaves together themes of love, loss, and the passage of time, creating a hauntingly beautiful and emotionally resonant piece that speaks to the universal experience of longing for a lost loved one.
