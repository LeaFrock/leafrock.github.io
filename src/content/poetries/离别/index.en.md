## Source Text

* 抹去黯淡的竹影
  
  剩下阴暗的天空
  
  看不见的
  
  是熟悉的笑容
  
* 走过灰色的长街
  
  握紧冰冷的双手
  
  驱不散的
  
  是凛冽的寒风
  
* 你眼里的我
  
  是落下的残花
  
  是远去的孤鸿
  
* 我离别的心
  
  是墙上的凹痕
  
  是亭外的断松
  
* 只好决然转身
  
  火车快要开动
  
  万不敢再回首
  
  早已泪眼朦胧

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Wipe away the dim bamboo shadows,
  
  Leaving the gloomy sky behind,
  
  What cannot be seen
  
  Is the familiar smile.

* Walk down the grey long street,
  
  Clenching the cold hands tight,
  
  What cannot be dispersed
  
  Is the biting cold wind.
  
* In your eyes, I am
  
  The fallen petals,
  
  The lone wild goose flying away.
  
* My parting heart
  
  Is the dent on the wall,
  
  The broken pine outside the pavilion.
  
* I can only turn resolutely,
  
  The train is about to start,
  
  I dare not look back,
  
  Already tears blur my sight.
