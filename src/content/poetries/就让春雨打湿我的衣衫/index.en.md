## Source Text

* 雨淋湿了路，
  
  倒映出一个模糊的世界。
  
  没有了清晰，
  
  只剩下不知所措的光影。

* 思绪，

  早已不止万万千千。
  
  干脆全都抹去，
  
  只剩下一副行尸走肉。

* 就让春雨打湿我的衣衫，

  仿佛思念打湿我的孤单，

  好像记忆打湿了我的梦，

  犹如距离打湿了她的影。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* The rain soaks the road,
  
  Reflecting a blurred world.
  
  Without clarity,
  
  Only bewildered light and shadow remain.

* Thoughts,

  Have long surpassed ten thousand.

  Might as well erase them all,

  Leaving just a hollow shell.

* Let the spring rain dampen my clothes,

  As if longing drenches my loneliness,

  As if memories soak my dreams,

  Like distance wets her shadow.
