## 原文

* 夜阑卧看星斗闷，
  
  银河翻云冷。
  
  金风娇衔玉露毫，
  
  画成万缕愁痕情思寥。
  
* 莫道人生如初遇，
  
  惘然眉间雨。
  
  秋深人老又十年，
  
  当时小窗纱漏月如弦。
  
## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* At night's end, lying down to gaze at the stars in gloom,
  
  The Milky Way churns with cold clouds.
  
  The gentle autumn breeze playfully holds the dewy tip,
  
  Sketching myriad lines of sorrow, thoughts grow thin.
  
* Don't say life is like the first encounter,
  
  Baffled, tears fall from the brows like rain.
  
  Deep into autumn, ten years older,
  
  Back then, the small window's gauze let through a crescent moon.

The mention of aging—"ten years older"—emphasizes the passage of time and the inevitability of change.
