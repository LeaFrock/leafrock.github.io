## Source Text

晨起慵懒卷帘迟，闻得窗外叶吟诗。

阶前水照映新颜，门下草长惹欢嬉。

青丝少壮逢知己，华发老朽叙平生。

不知彼人知此意？点滴雨声作相思。

## AI Translation

*Please translate my creation into an English poem.*

* Lazily rising at dawn, I roll up the curtains slow,

  Hearing leaves outside the window, as if they sing a poem.
  
* Water before the steps reflects a fresh new face,
  
  Grass by the door grows lush, inviting joy and play.

* In youth, with raven hair, I met a bosom friend,
  
  In age, with silver locks, I talk of life’s long road.

* I wonder if that dear one knows what’s in my heart,
  
  The pattering rain, my love, in every drop it shows.
