## 原文

* 杨柳丝丝弄轻柔，烟雨织成愁。
  
  往事总总，相思重重，懒吟春浓。
  
* 醉卧昏昏才入梦， 小桥又相逢。
  
  欲诉酸楚，惊雷催醒，叹上心头。

* Willow threads gently play with softness, Mist and rain weave a tapestry of sorrow.
  
  Memories pile up, longings grow heavy, Too despondent to sing of spring’s splendor.

>This poem, titled "Yan'er Mei: Lamenting Parting Sorrows," is a delicate and poignant expression of longing and the sorrow of separation. The poet skillfully uses vivid imagery and emotional depth to convey the pain of being apart from a beloved.
>
>In the first stanza, the poet sets the scene with the gentle play of "willow threads" and the sorrowful atmosphere created by "mist and rain." These natural elements not only create a picturesque setting but also serve as metaphors for the poet's emotional state. The "memories pile up" and "longings grow heavy," indicating the depth of the poet's nostalgia and the weight of his unfulfilled desires. The line "Too despondent to sing of spring’s splendor" highlights the poet's inability to appreciate the beauty of spring due to the overwhelming sorrow of separation.
>
>The second stanza transitions to a dream sequence, offering a brief respite from the pain of reality. The poet finds solace in a dream where he meets his beloved "on the small bridge," a place often associated with romance and longing in Chinese poetry. However, the moment he wishes to "pour out his heart’s distress," he is jolted awake by "thunder," leaving him with a heavy sigh. This abrupt return to reality emphasizes the fleeting nature of dreams and the enduring pain of separation.
>
>Overall, this poem captures the essence of longing and the sorrow of parting through rich imagery and emotional intensity. The contrast between the dream and reality highlights the poet's deep sense of loss and the poignant beauty of unfulfilled love.
